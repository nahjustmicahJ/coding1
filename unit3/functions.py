# A function is a set of instructions that will perform a 
# specific task

# there are two variations of functions: user-defined functions
#and built-in functions.

# built-in functions: instructions that have already been written,
# are built-in to the programming language

print('coding class') # print is a built-in function. we can identify functions 
# by the round brackets.

name= input('what is your name?')

print(name)
print(3*number)

# all date types, variables and operators are just places for us
# to use order to write instructions for functions

# user defined functions - custom functions created by an engineer.

# how do you write a user defined function.
